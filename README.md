# Classifying sentences related to climate change

I build a model to classify sentences as either *pro climate science* or *pro skeptic views about climate*

I train a sample of hand-coded sentences to fine-tuned the pre-trained BERT model and then use the fine-tuned model to finally predict the sentences' classes.

Code and outputs can be found in the notebook uploaded.
